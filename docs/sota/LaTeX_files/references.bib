We have developed {PyR}0, a hierarchical Bayesian multinomial logistic regression model that infers relative prevalence of all viral lineages across geographic regions, detects lineages increasing in prevalence, and identifies mutations relevant to fitness. Applying {PyR}0 to all publicly available {SARS}-{CoV}-2 genomes, we identify numerous substitutions that increase fitness, including previously identified spike mutations and many nonspike mutations within the nucleocapsid and nonstructural proteins. {PyR}0 forecasts growth of new lineages from their mutational profile, ranks the fitness of lineages as new sequences become available, and prioritizes mutations of biological and public health concern for functional characterization.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of the fitness effects of mutations to {SARS}-{CoV}-2 can inform assessment of new variants, design of therapeutics resistant to escape, and understanding of the functions of viral proteins. However, experimentally measuring effects of mutations is challenging: we lack tractable lab assays for many {SARS}-{CoV}-2 proteins, and comprehensive deep mutational scanning has been applied to only two {SARS}-{CoV}-2 proteins. Here, we develop an approach that leverages millions of publicly available {SARS}-{CoV}-2 sequences to estimate effects of mutations. We first calculate how many independent occurrences of each mutation are expected to be observed along the {SARS}-{CoV}-2 phylogeny in the absence of selection. We then compare these expected observations to the actual observations to estimate the effect of each mutation. These estimates correlate well with deep mutational scanning measurements. For most genes, synonymous mutations are nearly neutral, stop-codon mutations are deleterious, and amino acid mutations have a range of effects. However, some viral accessory proteins are under little to no selection. We provide interactive visualizations of effects of mutations to all {SARS}-{CoV}-2 proteins (https://jbloomlab.github.io/{SARS}2-mut-fitness/). The framework we describe is applicable to any virus for which the number of available sequences is sufficiently large that many independent occurrences of each neutral mutation are observed.},

	abstract = {During more than 3 years since its emergence, {SARS}-{CoV}-2 has shown great ability to mutate rapidly into diverse variants, some of which turned out to be very infectious and have spread throughout the world causing waves of infections. At this point, many countries have already experienced up to six waves of infections. Extensive academic work has focused on the development of models to predict the pandemic trajectory based on epidemiological data, but none has focused on predicting variant-specific spread. Moreover, important scientific literature analyzes the genetic evolution of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 variants and how it might functionally affect their infectivity. However, genetic attributes have not yet been incorporated into existing epidemiological modeling that aims to capture infection trajectory. Thus, this study leverages variant-specific genetic characteristics together with epidemiological information to systematically predict the future spread trajectory of newly detected variants. The study describes the analysis of 9.0 million {SARS}-{CoV}-2 genetic sequences in 30 countries and identifies temporal characteristic patterns of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 variants that caused significant infection waves. Using this descriptive analysis, a machine-learning-enabled risk assessment model has been developed to predict, as early as 1 week after their first detection, which variants are likely to constitute the new wave of infections in the following 3 months. The model’s out-of-sample area under the curve ({AUC}) is 86.3\% for predictions after 1 week and 90.8\% for predictions after 2 weeks. The methodology described in this paper could contribute more broadly to the development of improved predictive models for variants of other infectious viruses.},

	abstract = {Computational multi-scale pandemic modelling remains a major and timely challenge. Here we identify specific requirements for a new class of models simulating pandemics across three scales: (1) pathogen evolution, often punctuated by the rapid emergence of new variants, (2) human interactions within a heterogeneous population, and (3) public health responses which constrain individual actions to control the disease transmission. We then present a pandemic modelling framework satisfying these requirements and capable of simulating feedback loops between dynamics unfolding at these different scales. The developed framework comprises a stochastic agent-based model of pandemic spread, coupled with a phylodynamic model that incorporates within-host pathogen evolution. It is validated with a case study, modelling the punctuated evolution of {SARS}-{CoV}-2, based on global and contemporary genomic surveillance data, which captures a large heterogeneous population. We demonstrate that the model replicates the essential features of the {COVID}-19 pandemic and virus evolution, while retaining computational tractability and scalability., Accurate modelling of pandemic spread is highly challenging due to the unpredictable nature of emerging and evolving pathogens, the diversity of populations with unevenly distributed risks, and the dynamic public health interventions that adapt to rapidly changing situations. In this work, we developed a novel computational framework designed to capture the complexities of infectious disease transmission across heterogeneous populations, accounting for the impact of public health measures. Additionally, our model incorporates a phylodynamic approach to simulate the evolution of pathogens within individual hosts. By integrating contemporary genomic, demographic, and mobility data, we validated our model through a case study that replicated key characteristics of the recent {COVID}-19 pandemic. Notably, our simulation, in line with real-world observations, demonstrated the punctuated evolution of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 and the emergence and spread of various viral variants. Specifically, the model linked pathogen evolution to the dynamics of social interactions and the effects of public health interventions, showcasing the power of multi-scale modelling in exploring the complexities of pandemic scenarios.},

	abstract = {{SARS}-{CoV}-2 employs its spike protein’s receptor binding domain ({RBD}) to enter host cells. The {RBD} is constantly subjected to immune responses, while requiring efficient binding to host cell receptors for successful infection. However, our understanding of how {RBD}’s biophysical properties contribute to {SARS}-{CoV}-2’s epidemiological fitness remains largely incomplete. Through a comprehensive approach, comprising large-scale sequence analysis of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 variants and the identification of a fitness function based on binding thermodynamics, we unravel the relationship between the biophysical properties of {RBD} variants and their contribution to viral fitness. We developed a biophysical model that uses statistical mechanics to map the molecular phenotype space, characterized by dissociation constants of {RBD} to {ACE}2, {LY}-{CoV}016, {LY}-{CoV}555, {REGN}10987, and S309, onto an epistatic fitness landscape. We validate our findings through experimentally measured and machine learning ({ML}) estimated binding affinities, coupled with infectivity data derived from population-level sequencing. Our analysis reveals that this model effectively predicts the fitness of novel {RBD} variants and can account for the epistatic interactions among mutations, including explaining the later reversal of Q493R. Our study sheds light on the impact of specific mutations on viral fitness and delivers a tool for predicting the future epidemiological trajectory of previously unseen or emerging low-frequency variants. These insights offer not only greater understanding of viral evolution but also potentially aid in guiding public health decisions in the battle against {COVID}-19 and future pandemics.},

Here we describe the methodology of Covasim ({COVID}-19 Agent-based Simulator), an open-source model developed to help address these questions. Covasim includes country-specific demographic information on age structure and population size; realistic transmission networks in different social layers, including households, schools, workplaces, long-term care facilities, and communities; age-specific disease outcomes; and intrahost viral dynamics, including viral-load-based transmissibility. Covasim also supports an extensive set of interventions, including non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as physical distancing and protective equipment; pharmaceutical interventions, including vaccination; and testing interventions, such as symptomatic and asymptomatic testing, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine. These interventions can incorporate the effects of delays, loss-to-follow-up, micro-targeting, and other factors. Implemented in pure Python, Covasim has been designed with equal emphasis on performance, ease of use, and flexibility: realistic and highly customized scenarios can be run on a standard laptop in under a minute. In collaboration with local health agencies and policymakers, Covasim has already been applied to examine epidemic dynamics and inform policy decisions in more than a dozen countries in Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, and North America.},

As our knowledge of influenza virus evolution, distribution, and transmission has increased, paths to pandemic preparedness have become apparent. In the 1950s, the World Health Organization ({WHO}) established a global influenza surveillance network that is now composed of institutions in 122 member states. This and other surveillance networks monitor circulating influenza strains in humans and animal reservoirs and are primed to detect influenza strains with pandemic potential. Both the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the {WHO} have also developed pandemic risk assessment tools that evaluate specific aspects of emerging influenza strains to develop a systematic process of determining research and funding priorities according to the risk of emergence and potential impact. Here, we review the history of influenza pandemic preparedness and the current state of preparedness, and we propose additional measures for improvement. We also comment on the intersection between the influenza pandemic preparedness network and the current {SARS}-{CoV}-2 crisis. We must continually evaluate and revise our risk assessment and pandemic preparedness plans and incorporate new information gathered from research and global crises.},

These variants can increase rates of virus transmission and/or increase the risk of reinfection and reduce the protection afforded by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and vaccination. These variants can therefore enable {SARS}-{CoV}-2 to continue its spread in the face of rising population immunity while maintaining or increasing its replication fitness. The identification of four rapidly expanding virus lineages since December 2020, designated variants of concern, has ushered in a new stage of the pandemic. The four variants of concern, the Alpha variant (originally identified in the {UK}), the Beta variant (originally identified in South Africa), the Gamma variant (originally identified in Brazil) and the Delta variant (originally identified in India), share several mutations with one another as well as with an increasing number of other recently identified {SARS}-{CoV}-2 variants.
